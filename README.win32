INSTALLING ON WIN32:

	Because of unix/Win32 file differences, the test file fun.txt, used in
	the t\Decoder.t test, is different when the distribution is unpacked
	with the cygwin tar/gunzip tools compared to when Winzip is used
	(using the default options). The one created with Winzip is the one to
	use to pass the tests.
